{% block explanation %}
 <p>Drones allow opening previously unavailable opportunities – to see the
    invisible and reach the unreachable – not only in the air but also on
    the ground and underwater. Drawing on our 30-year experience in
    software development, we discover drone software architecture, discuss
    a basic and extended set of features for modern drone apps, and give
    an overview of trends that are likely to shape the future of drone
    software development. </p>

  <p>Modern drones are not only about thrilling aerial footages. Drones are
     gaining popularity across all kinds of markets. By the year 2022, the
     commercial drone market is expected to reach $10,738 million. According
     to Goldman Sachs, the fastest adopters of drone techs will be such
     industries as:</p><br>
     <ul>
       <li> <strong>Construction:</strong>
         Surveying buildings; creating contour maps; building roads and
         railways; counting construction supplies.
       </li>
       <li> <strong>Agriculture:</strong>
         Monitoring plants and livestock; monitoring water use; spraying crops.
       </li>
       <li> <strong>Insurance:</strong>
         Damage inspection; risk assessment; fraud monitoring.
       </li>
       <li> <strong>Oil & gas:</strong>
         Laying and monitoring oils & gas pipelines.
       </li>
       <li> <strong>Security:</strong>
        Monitoring state boundaries; ensuring security during public events.
       </li>
     </ul>

  <p>Traditional monolithic applications are deployed as a single package,
     usually as a web or enterprise-archive file (WAR or EAR). They contain
     all the business logic required to complete multiple tasks, often alongside
     the components required to render the user interface (UI, or GUI
     for graphical user interface). When scaling, this usually means taking a
     complete copy of that entire application archive onto a new server
     node (basically, deploying it to another server node in a cluster).
     It doesn’t matter where the load or bottleneck is occurring; even if it’s
     only in a small cross section of the application, scaling this way is an
     all-or-nothing approach. Microservices are specifically designed to target
     and change this all-or-nothing aspect by allowing you to break your business
      logic into smaller, more manageable elements that can be employed in
      multiple ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    Microservices offer you the advantage of being able to scale individual
    services, and the ability to develop and maintain multiple services in
    parallel using several teams, but they still require a robust approach when
    it comes to testing.
